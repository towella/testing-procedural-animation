o optimise trig code with dot products

o Restrict body segment joint rotation (FABRIK body)
o Add torque to body segments

-------
o Restrict hip joint (legpair, if angle between seg rot and anchor to foot > set angle, force step)
o Fix leg double stepping
o FABRIK
    - Add support for inverted insect esque legs
    - Add restrictions to elbows
    - Problems with IK with custom leg segment lengths
-------

o Fix collisions
    - feet
    - elbow
    - body segment

o Make pathfinding work with:
    - joint restriction
    - fix pathfinding with circle colliders
    - Problem when target is too close to head (less than sensitivity value) (set view rad to 20 in brain)
o Optimise pathfinding

o sprite stacking
    - cache texture rotations
    - fix tiles popping out of frame

--------------------------------------------------------------------
o Procedurally generated terrain (dungeon terminal game)
o Sprite stacking projection

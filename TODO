o optimise trig code with dot products

o Restrict body segment joint rotation (FABRIK body)
o Add torque to body segments

-------
o Restrict hip joint (legpair, if angle between seg rot and anchor to foot > set angle, force step)
o Fix leg double stepping
o FABRIK
    - Add support for inverted insect esque legs
    - Add restrictions to elbows
    - Problems with IK with custom leg segment lengths
-------

o Fix collisions
    - feet
    - elbow
    - body segment

o Make pathfinding work with:
    - collisions (use circle colliders?)
    - joint restriction
o Optimise pathfinding

o Procedurally generated terrain (dungeon terminal game)
o Sprite stacking projection
o rotation around head
